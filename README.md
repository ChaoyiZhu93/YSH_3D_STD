# Deformation Field Around a Surface Threading Dislocation Based on Yoffe-Shaibani-Hazzeldine model

This repository contains some scripts to compute the deformation field around a surface threading dislocation (edge and screw) and generate input .h5 file for the EMsoftdefect program.

Details of the mathematical formulation can be found in the included [YSH-Theoretical Model](YSH-Theoretical-Model.pdf) document.

## Financial Support 
EBSD/ECP/EKP development of this package, including dictionary indexing for EBSD/ECP, was started with support from an AFOSR/MURI grant, FA9550-12-1-0458; the original EBSD code from CTEMsoft 2.0 was developed with support from an ONR grant, N00014-12-1-0075.  All recent development of EMsoft was performed with support from an ONR Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, N00014-­16-­1-­2821.
